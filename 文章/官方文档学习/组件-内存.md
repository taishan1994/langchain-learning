## 基本介绍和使用

默认情况下，链和代理是无状态的，这意味着它们独立处理每个传入的查询（就像底层的LLM和聊天模型本身）。在一些应用中，如聊天机器人，必须记住以前的互动，包括短期和长期的互动。Memory类正是这样做的。

LangChain以两种形式提供内存组件。首先，LangChain提供了用于管理和操作先前聊天信息的辅助工具。这些被设计成模块化的，无论如何使用都是有用的。其次，LangChain提供了简单的方法来将这些实用工具纳入链中。

内存涉及到在用户与语言模型的互动过程中保持一个状态的概念。用户与语言模型的交互在聊天信息（ChatMessages）的概念中被捕获，因此这可以归结为从一连串的聊天信息中摄取、捕获、转换和提取知识。有许多不同的方法可以做到这一点，每一种方法都作为自己的内存类型存在。

一般来说，对于每种类型的内存，有两种理解使用内存的方式。这些是独立的函数，从一连串的消息中提取信息，然后是你可以在一个链中使用这种类型的内存。

内存可以返回多条信息（例如，最近的N条信息和以前所有信息的摘要）。返回的信息可以是一个字符串，也可以是一个信息列表。

我们将走过最简单的内存形式： "缓冲区 "内存，它只涉及到保留所有先前消息的缓冲区。我们将展示如何在这里使用模块化的实用函数，然后展示如何在一个链中使用它（既返回一个字符串，也返回一个信息列表）。

### ChatMessageHistory

支撑大多数（如果不是全部）内存模块的核心实用类之一是ChatMessageHistory类。这是一个超级轻量级的封装器，它暴露了保存人类消息、人工智能消息的便利方法，然后将它们全部获取。

如果你在链外管理内存，你可能想直接使用这个类。

```python
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory

history = ChatMessageHistory()

history.add_user_message("hi!")

history.add_ai_message("whats up?")

history.messages

    [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),
     AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]
```

### ConversationBufferMemory

现在我们展示如何在一个链中使用这个简单的概念。我们首先展示ConversationBufferMemory，它只是ChatMessageHistory的一个包装器，可以提取变量中的消息。

我们首先可以把它提取成一个字符串。

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.chat_memory.add_user_message("hi!")
memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message("whats up?")

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': 'Human: hi!\nAI: whats up?'}
```

我们也可以以信息列表的形式获得历史信息。

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.chat_memory.add_user_message("hi!")
memory.chat_memory.add_ai_message("whats up?")

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]}

```

### 在链中使用

最后，让我们看看在一个链中使用这个（设置verbose=True，这样我们就可以看到提示）。

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)

conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")



    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

    Current conversation:

    Human: Hi there!
    AI:

    > Finished chain.





    " Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"


conversation.predict(input="I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.")



    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

    Current conversation:
    Human: Hi there!
    AI:  Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?
    Human: I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.
    AI:

    > Finished chain.





    " That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?"


conversation.predict(input="Tell me about yourself.")



    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

    Current conversation:
    Human: Hi there!
    AI:  Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?
    Human: I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.
    AI:  That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?
    Human: Tell me about yourself.
    AI:

    > Finished chain.





    " Sure! I'm an AI created to help people with their everyday tasks. I'm programmed to understand natural language and provide helpful information. I'm also constantly learning and updating my knowledge base so I can provide more accurate and helpful answers."

```

### 存储历史消息

你可能经常需要保存信息，然后再加载它们来使用。这可以很容易地做到，首先将消息转换为普通的Python字典，将其保存（以json或其他方式），然后再加载这些消息。下面是一个这样做的例子。

```python
import json

from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain.schema import messages_from_dict, messages_to_dict

history = ChatMessageHistory()

history.add_user_message("hi!")

history.add_ai_message("whats up?")

dicts = messages_to_dict(history.messages)

dicts

    [{'type': 'human', 'data': {'content': 'hi!', 'additional_kwargs': {}}},
     {'type': 'ai', 'data': {'content': 'whats up?', 'additional_kwargs': {}}}]

new_messages = messages_from_dict(dicts)

new_messages

    [HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}),
     AIMessage(content='whats up?', additional_kwargs={})]


```

就这样开始了! 有很多不同类型的存储器，请查看我们的例子，看看它们都是什么。

## 如何向LLMChain添加内存

本笔记本将介绍如何在LLMChain中使用Memory类。为了这个演练的目的，我们将添加ConversationBufferMemory类，尽管它可以是任何内存类。

最重要的一步是正确设置提示符。在下面的提示中，我们有两个输入键：一个用于实际输入，另一个用于来自Memory类的输入。重要的是，我们要确保PromptTemplate和ConversationBufferMemory中的键是一致的（chat_history）。

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain, PromptTemplate

template = """You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human.

{chat_history}
Human: {human_input}
Chatbot:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["chat_history", "human_input"], template=template
)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")

llm_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    prompt=prompt,
    verbose=True,
    memory=memory,
)

llm_chain.predict(human_input="Hi there my friend")

    
    
    > Entering new LLMChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human.
    
    
    Human: Hi there my friend
    Chatbot:
    
    > Finished LLMChain chain.





    ' Hi there, how are you doing today?'

llm_chain.predict(human_input="Not too bad - how are you?")

    
    
    > Entering new LLMChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human.
    
    
    Human: Hi there my friend
    AI:  Hi there, how are you doing today?
    Human: Not too bad - how are you?
    Chatbot:
    
    > Finished LLMChain chain.





    " I'm doing great, thank you for asking!"
```

## 如何向多输入链添加内存

大多数内存对象都假定有一个单一的输入。在这个笔记本中，我们将讨论如何将内存添加到一个有多个输入的链中。作为这种链的一个例子，我们将为一个问题/回答链添加内存。这个链把相关的文档和用户的问题作为输入。

```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.embeddings.cohere import CohereEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores.elastic_vector_search import ElasticVectorSearch
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.docstore.document import Document

with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

docsearch = Chroma.from_texts(
    texts, embeddings, metadatas=[{"source": i} for i in range(len(texts))]
)

    Running Chroma using direct local API.
    Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.

query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query)

from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

template = """You are a chatbot having a conversation with a human.

Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer.

{context}

{chat_history}
Human: {human_input}
Chatbot:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["chat_history", "human_input", "context"], template=template
)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", input_key="human_input")
chain = load_qa_chain(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), chain_type="stuff", memory=memory, prompt=prompt
)


query = "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
chain({"input_documents": docs, "human_input": query}, return_only_outputs=True)

    {'output_text': ' Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.'}


print(chain.memory.buffer)

    
    Human: What did the president say about Justice Breyer
    AI:  Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.



```

## 如何为代理添加内存

这本笔记本介绍了向Agent添加内存的情况。在阅读本笔记本之前，请先阅读下面的笔记本，因为本笔记本将建立在这两个笔记本的基础之上：

- 为LLM链添加内存
- 自定义代理

为了给一个代理添加内存，我们将采取以下步骤：

- 我们将创建一个带有内存的LLMC链。
- 我们将使用该LLMC链来创建一个自定义代理。

在这个练习中，我们将创建一个简单的自定义代理，它可以访问搜索工具并使用ConversationBufferMemory类。

```python
from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper

search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
    )
]
```

注意PromptTemplate中chat_history变量的使用，它与ConversationBufferMemory中的动态键名一致。

```python
prefix = """Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:"""
suffix = """Begin!"

{chat_history}
Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}"""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools,
    prefix=prefix,
    suffix=suffix,
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history", "agent_scratchpad"],
)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
```

我们现在可以用Memory对象构建LLMChain，然后创建代理。

```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)
agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, memory=memory
)

agent_chain.run(input="How many people live in canada?")

    
    
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to find out the population of Canada
    Action: Search

    'The current population of Canada is 38,566,192 as of Saturday, December 31, 2022, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.'

```

为了测试这个代理人的记忆力，我们可以问一个后续问题，这个问题要依靠前一次交流中的信息才能回答正确。

```python
agent_chain.run(input="what is their national anthem called?")

    > Finished AgentExecutor chain.

```

我们可以看到，代理人记得之前的问题是关于加拿大的，并正确地问了谷歌搜索加拿大国歌的名字。

有趣的是，让我们把它与一个没有记忆的代理人进行比较。

## 在代理中添加由数据库支持的消息存储器

这本笔记本介绍了向Agent添加内存的情况，其中内存使用了一个外部消息存储。在阅读本笔记本之前，请先阅读以下笔记本，因为本笔记本将建立在这两个笔记本之上：

- 为LLM链添加内存
- 自定义代理
- 带有内存的代理

为了给代理添加一个带有外部消息存储的内存，我们将采取以下步骤：

- 我们将创建一个RedisChatMessageHistory来连接外部数据库以存储消息。
- 我们将使用该聊天历史作为内存创建一个LLMChain。
- 我们将使用该LLMChain来创建一个自定义代理。

在本练习中，我们将创建一个简单的自定义代理，它可以访问搜索工具并使用ConversationBufferMemory类。

```python
from langchain.agents import ZeroShotAgent, Tool, AgentExecutor
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.memory.chat_memory import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain.memory.chat_message_histories import RedisChatMessageHistory
from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper

search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
    )
]
```

注意PromptTemplate中chat_history变量的使用，它与ConversationBufferMemory中的动态键名一致。

```python
prefix = """Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:"""
suffix = """Begin!"

{chat_history}
Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}"""

prompt = ZeroShotAgent.create_prompt(
    tools,
    prefix=prefix,
    suffix=suffix,
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history", "agent_scratchpad"],
)

```

现在我们可以创建由数据库支持的ChatMessageHistory。

```python
message_history = RedisChatMessageHistory(
    url="redis://localhost:6379/0", ttl=600, session_id="my-session"
)

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history", chat_memory=message_history
)
```

我们现在可以用Memory对象构建LLMChain，然后创建代理。

```python
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), prompt=prompt)
agent = ZeroShotAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, tools=tools, verbose=True)
agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, memory=memory
)

agent_chain.run(input="How many people live in canada?")

    'The current population of Canada is 38,566,192 as of Saturday, December 31, 2022, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data.'

```

为了测试这个代理人的记忆力，我们可以问一个后续的问题，这个问题要依靠之前交流中的信息才能回答正确。

```python

## 会话缓冲存储器

这个笔记本展示了如何使用ConversationBufferMemory。这个内存允许存储消息，然后将消息提取到一个变量中。

我们可以先把它提取成一个字符串。

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}
```

我们还可以将历史记录作为信息列表来获取（如果你将其与聊天模型一起使用，这很有用）。

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

### 在链中使用

最后，让我们看看在一个链中使用这个（设置verbose=True，这样我们就可以看到提示）。

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    verbose=True, 
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)

conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")

    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    
    Current conversation:
    
    Human: Hi there!
    AI:
    
    > Finished chain.





    " Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"


conversation.predict(input="I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.")

    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    
    Current conversation:
    Human: Hi there!
    AI:  Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?
    Human: I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.
    AI:
    
    > Finished chain.





    " That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?"


conversation.predict(input="Tell me about yourself.")

    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
    
    Current conversation:
    Human: Hi there!
    AI:  Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?
    Human: I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.
    AI:  That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?
    Human: Tell me about yourself.
    AI:

    " Sure! I'm an AI created to help people with their everyday tasks. I'm programmed to understand natural language and provide helpful information. I'm also constantly learning and updating my knowledge base so I can provide more accurate and helpful answers."

```

就这样开始了! 有很多不同类型的存储器，请查看我们的例子，看看它们都是什么。

## 会话缓冲窗口内存

ConversationBufferWindowMemory保留了一个对话的互动列表，随着时间的推移。它只使用最后的K个互动。这对于保持最近的交互的滑动窗口很有用，所以缓冲区不会变得太大

让我们首先探讨一下这种类型的内存的基本功能。

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}


```

我们还可以将历史记录作为信息列表来获取（如果你将其与聊天模型一起使用，这很有用）。

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='not much you', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='not much', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

### 在链中使用

### AI Prefix

第一个方法是改变对话摘要中的AI前缀。默认情况下，这被设置为 "AI"，但你可以将其设置为任何你想要的东西。请注意，如果你改变了这个，你也应该改变链中使用的提示，以反映这个命名的变化。让我们在下面的例子中了解一下这个问题。

```python

```

## 如何创建一个自定义的Memory类

尽管LangChain中有一些预定义的内存类型，但你极有可能想添加你自己的内存类型，使之成为你的应用程序的最佳选择。这个笔记本涵盖了如何做到这一点。

在这个笔记本中，我们将为ConversationChain添加一个自定义内存类型。为了添加一个自定义的内存类，我们需要导入基础内存类并将其子类化。

在这个例子中，我们将编写一个自定义的内存类，使用spacy来提取实体，并将关于它们的信息保存在一个简单的哈希表中。然后，在对话过程中，我们将查看输入文本，提取任何实体，并将关于它们的任何信息放入上下文中。

请注意，这个实现是非常简单和脆弱的，在生产环境中可能没有用。它的目的是为了展示你可以添加自定义的内存实现。
为此，我们将需要spacy。

`pip install spact` 

`python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg`

```python
from langchain import OpenAI, ConversationChain
from langchain.schema import BaseMemory
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Any

class SpacyEntityMemory(BaseMemory, BaseModel):
    """Memory class for storing information about entities."""

    # Define dictionary to store information about entities.
    entities: dict = {}
    # Define key to pass information about entities into prompt.
    memory_key: str = "entities"

    def clear(self):
        self.entities = {}

    @property
    def memory_variables(self) -> List[str]:
        """Define the variables we are providing to the prompt."""
        return [self.memory_key]

    def load_memory_variables(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Load the memory variables, in this case the entity key."""
        # Get the input text and run through spacy
        doc = nlp(inputs[list(inputs.keys())[0]])
        # Extract known information about entities, if they exist.
        entities = [
            self.entities[str(ent)] for ent in doc.ents if str(ent) in self.entities
        ]
        # Return combined information about entities to put into context.
        return {self.memory_key: "\n".join(entities)}

    def save_context(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any], outputs: Dict[str, str]) -> None:
        """Save context from this conversation to buffer."""
        # Get the input text and run through spacy
        text = inputs[list(inputs.keys())[0]]
        doc = nlp(text)
        # For each entity that was mentioned, save this information to the dictionary.
        for ent in doc.ents:
            ent_str = str(ent)
            if ent_str in self.entities:
                self.entities[ent_str] += f"\n{text}"
            else:
                self.entities[ent_str] = text
```

我们现在定义一个提示，它接收关于实体的信息以及用户输入的信息

```python
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

template = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know. You are provided with information about entities the Human mentions, if relevant.

Relevant entity information:
{entities}

Conversation:
Human: {input}
AI:"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["entities", "input"], template=template)


And now we put it all together!

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, memory=SpacyEntityMemory()

```

在第一个例子中，由于没有关于哈里森的预先知识，"相关实体信息 "部分是空的。

```python
conversation.predict(input="Harrison likes machine learning")

    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know. You are provided with information about entities the Human mentions, if relevant.
    
    Relevant entity information:
    
    
    Conversation:
    Human: Harrison likes machine learning
    AI:
    
    > Finished ConversationChain chain.





    " That's great to hear! Machine learning is a fascinating field of study. It involves using algorithms to analyze data and make predictions. Have you ever studied machine learning, Harrison?"

```

现在在第二个例子中，我们可以看到，它拉来了关于哈里森的信息。

```python
conversation.predict(
    input="What do you think Harrison's favorite subject in college was?"
)

    
    
    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...

If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know. You are provided with information about entities the Human mentions, if relevant.
    
    Relevant entity information:
    Harrison likes machine learning
    
    Conversation:
    Human: What do you think Harrison's favorite subject in college was?
    AI:
    
    > Finished ConversationChain chain.





    ' From what I know about Harrison, I believe his favorite subject in college was machine learning. He has expressed a strong interest in the subject and has mentioned it often.'

```

请再次注意，这个实现是非常简单和脆弱的，在生产环境中可能没有用。它的目的是为了展示你可以添加自定义的内存实现。

## 实体内存

实体记忆能记住对话中关于特定实体的给定事实。它提取关于实体的信息（使用LLM），并随着时间的推移建立关于该实体的知识（也使用LLM）。

让我们先来看看这个功能的使用情况。

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.memory import ConversationEntityMemory
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

memory = ConversationEntityMemory(llm=llm)

## 会话知识图谱内存

这种类型的内存使用知识图谱来重新创建内存。

让我们先来看看如何使用这些工具

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationKGMemory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
memory = ConversationKGMemory(llm=llm)
memory.save_context({"input": "say hi to sam"}, {"output": "who is sam"})
memory.save_context({"input": "sam is a friend"}, {"output": "okay"})

memory.load_memory_variables({"input": "who is sam"})

    {'history': 'On Sam: Sam is friend.'}

We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).

memory = ConversationKGMemory(llm=llm, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "say hi to sam"}, {"output": "who is sam"})
memory.save_context({"input": "sam is a friend"}, {"output": "okay"})

memory.load_memory_variables({"input": "who is sam"})

    {'history': [SystemMessage(content='On Sam: Sam is friend.', additional_kwargs={})]}



```

我们也可以更模块化地从一个新的消息中获得当前的实体（将使用以前的消息作为背景。

```python
memory.get_current_entities("what's Sams favorite color?")

    ['Sam']

# 我们还可以更加模块化地从新消息中获取知识三要素（将使用以前的消息作为背景。）

memory.get_knowledge_triplets("her favorite color is red")

    [KnowledgeTriple(subject='Sam', predicate='favorite color', object_='red')]
```

## 对话总结内存

现在让我们来看看使用一种稍微复杂的内存类型--ConversationSummaryMemory。这种类型的内存会创建一个随时间变化的对话摘要。这对于浓缩一段时间内的对话信息很有用。会话摘要内存在对话发生时对其进行总结，并将当前的摘要存储在内存中。然后，这个内存可以用来将到目前为止的对话摘要注入提示/链中。这个内存对较长的对话最有用，因为在提示中逐字保存过去的信息历史会占用太多标记。

让我们首先探讨一下这种类型的记忆体的基本功能。

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory, ChatMessageHistory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0))
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': '\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.'}
```

我们还可以将历史记录作为信息列表来获取（如果你将其与聊天模型一起使用，这很有用）。

```python
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': [SystemMessage(content='\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.', additional_kwargs={})]}

```

我们也可以直接利用predict_new_summary方法。

```python
messages = memory.chat_memory.messages
previous_summary = ""
memory.predict_new_summary(messages, previous_summary)

    '\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.'
```

### 初始化消息

如果你有这个类之外的消息，你可以很容易地用ChatMessageHistory来初始化这个类。在加载过程中，将计算出一个摘要。

```python
history = ChatMessageHistory()
history.add_user_message("hi")
history.add_ai_message("hi there!")

memory = ConversationSummaryMemory.from_messages(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0), chat_memory=history, return_messages=True)


memory.buffer

    '\nThe human greets the AI, to which the AI responds with a friendly greeting.'

```

### 在链中使用

让我们通过一个在链中使用这个的例子，再次设置verbose=True，这样我们就可以看到提示。

## 对话摘要缓冲区内存

ConversationSummaryBufferMemory结合了上两个想法。它在内存中保留了一个最近的交互的缓冲区，但它并不只是完全刷新旧的交互，而是将它们编译成一个摘要，并同时使用。但与之前的实现不同，它使用token长度而不是交互的数量来决定何时刷新交互。

让我们先来看看如何使用这些工具

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryBufferMemory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI()

memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': 'System: \nThe human says "hi", and the AI responds with "whats up".\nHuman: not much you\nAI: not much'}

```

我们还可以将历史记录作为信息列表来获取（如果你将其与聊天模型一起使用，这很有用）。

```python
memory = ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(
    llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True
)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

我们也可以直接利用predict_new_summary方法。

### 在链中使用

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing.
    memory=ConversationSummaryBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=40),
    verbose=True,
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")

## 对话标记缓冲区内存

ConversationTokenBufferMemory在内存中保留了一个最近的交互的缓冲区，并使用token长度而不是交互的数量来决定何时刷新交互。

让我们先来看看如何使用这些工具

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationTokenBufferMemory
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI()

memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})

memory.load_memory_variables({})

    {'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}
    
memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(
    llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True

## 矢量存储支持的存储器

VectorStoreRetrieverMemory在一个VectorDB中存储记忆，并在每次调用时查询前K个最 "突出 "的文档。

这与其他大多数Memory类的不同之处在于，它并不明确地跟踪交互的顺序。

在这种情况下，"文档 "是以前的对话片段。这对于参考人工智能在对话中早期被告知的相关信息很有用。

### 初始化你的向量存储

根据你选择的存储方式，这一步可能会有所不同。请查阅相关的VectorStore文档以了解更多细节。

```python
from datetime import datetime
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.memory import VectorStoreRetrieverMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

import faiss

from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS


embedding_size = 1536 # Dimensions of the OpenAIEmbeddings
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)
embedding_fn = OpenAIEmbeddings().embed_query
vectorstore = FAISS(embedding_fn, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})
```

### 创建VectorStoreRetrieverMemory

内存对象是由任何VectorStoreRetriever实例化的。

```python
# In actual usage, you would set `k` to be a higher value, but we use k=1 to show that
# the vector lookup still returns the semantically relevant information
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs=dict(k=1))
memory = VectorStoreRetrieverMemory(retriever=retriever)

# When added to an agent, the memory object can save pertinent information from conversations or used tools
memory.save_context({"input": "My favorite food is pizza"}, {"output": "thats good to know"})
memory.save_context({"input": "My favorite sport is soccer"}, {"output": "..."})
memory.save_context({"input": "I don't the Celtics"}, {"output": "ok"}) #


# Notice the first result returned is the memory pertaining to tax help, which the language model deems more semantically relevant
# to a 1099 than the other documents, despite them both containing numbers.
print(memory.load_memory_variables({"prompt": "what sport should i watch?"})["history"])


    input: My favorite sport is soccer
    output: ...
```

### 在链中使用
